# MERG block detection node based on a Arduino Mega

Code is here for demonstration purposes only and is used on my layout.

The sketch is using address 10 for the cmri node in jmri.

Its based on an arduino mega and pins 0,1, 2 and 13 are nout used in this sketch.

Jmri uses 10001 to 10033 to read all the inputs from the MERG kit 50 sensors attached

The code is quite straight forwad so will not explain it in the readme file
